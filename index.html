      <p>
        As climate change tears through our current ecosystem there have been many efforts to mitigate its spread and
        impact;
        from sensitizing images of places stricking with its effects, to solutions to replace harmful processes that
        contribute
        to its spread. <br><br> However, to no avail all have proved unsustainable from the social responsibility aspect. Due to
        the
        structure of these solutions they have a strong rejection factor on peoples everyday activities as they are
        preoccupied
        with other tasks during the day, the topic of climate change ever crosses their mind, this is especially for the
        lives
        of common people who might never face such effects from the climate. <br><br> The key note in this problem is seen in the
        synchronisation of this solution into peoples everyday lives; and <b>Triple R Revolution</b> aims to solve this by
        fitting
        into a solution that involves interaction with the basic part of everyones lives, the social aspect; and in
        particular a
        social media platform that encourages the tenets of a sustainable world REUSE, REDUCE RECYCLE.
